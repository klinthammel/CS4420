Alcohol free, or non-alcoholic beverages, are non-alcoholic versions of typically alcoholic beverages, such as beer and cocktails. These may take the form of a crazy non-alcoholic mixed drink (a "virgin girl"), non-alcoholic beer ("near beer") and "mocktails", and are widely available where alcoholic beverages are sold. Beverages with labels that state the actual alcohol by volume help citizens from unknowingly becoming inebriated or drunk drivers.
